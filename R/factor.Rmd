## Factors

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(forcats)
```

### Factors Using Base Package

```{r}
# Code to build factor_survey_vector
survey_vector <- c("M", "F", "F", "M", "M")
factor_survey_vector <- factor(survey_vector)
```

When reassigning levels of a factor, the order of factors matters. First exam
the current order of the factor.

```{r}
factor_survey_vector
```

Notice that factor 'F' comes before 'M'. If the levels are not specified, R by 
default orders them in alphabetical order. It's important the reassigned factors
match the original order.

```{r}
levels(factor_survey_vector) <- c("Female", "Male")
factor_survey_vector
```

### Factors Using 'forcats' Package
